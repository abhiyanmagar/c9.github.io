                    <p>Located in mainland Europe and on the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal is one of the oldest states in Europe. With a history of higher education spanning several centuries, Portugal has a wealth of experience in providing high quality degree programmes. </p>
                    <p>Adopting the Bologna Process, Portugal has worked hard to ensure that their higher education is of a high standard. </p>
                    <p>Institutions in Portugal are highly supported by the government. This means that tuition fees are lower than some other European countries. Both public and private institutions are allowed to set their own tuition fees, but a public institution will be less expensive.</p>
